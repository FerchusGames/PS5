# Tray Dash

Tray Dash is a unique endless runner where players balance a tray of food items while navigating a dynamic path to the delivery point. You'll face challenges like wind and curvy paths, making each run a test of skill and strategy. Ideal for casual gamers seeking a satisfying and engaging experience, Tray Dash features a low-poly art style with vibrant colors and fun audio.

It was made as an academic project by Fernando Gonzalez, Itzel Llamas, Juan Rios, Patricio Perez and Sergio Sanchez.
